JStats
======
JStats is a utility that (upon completion) pulls recent results for a player from sizzlingstats.com and prints them to console. 
There is potential for it to find stats specific to the player as well, I have not decided to prioritize this yet.
During design phase, the steam64 player id will be scanned in, though functionally the end program will have it passed as a parameter.

Foreseeable Use
======
I plan to use or adapt this program in Boulderbot at some point. 
Mainly, this is just a challenge to myself as this utility has vexed me as it remained incomplete.
